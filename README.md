# AnimalAngle Detector

## Project Description

The AnimalAngle Detector is an innovative machine learning project that combines image classification and viewpoint detection to provide valuable insights into images containing animals, with a primary focus on dogs and cats. This project offers a versatile solution with the ability to classify animals and determine the viewpoint or perspective from which a picture was taken.

## Key Features

1. **Animal Classification:** The project uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to accurately classify images as either dogs or cats. This classification can be beneficial for a wide range of applications, including pet monitoring, wildlife conservation, and more.

2. **Viewpoint Detection:** Beyond animal classification, the AnimalAngle Detector takes it a step further by detecting the viewpoint from which the image was captured. It can determine if the animal is facing left, right, towards the camera, or from a different angle. This viewpoint detection enhances the understanding of the animal's behavior and orientation in the image.

3. **Practical Applications:** This project finds applications in various domains, such as pet care, wildlife research, photography enhancement, and more. For instance, it can help pet owners monitor their pets remotely, assist in wildlife tracking and behavior analysis, or optimize photo editing by understanding the subject's perspective.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The AnimalAngle Detector comes with an intuitive user interface, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. Users can upload images and receive instant feedback on animal classification and viewpoint detection.

## Ethical Considerations

We are committed to ethical data usage and respect for animals' well-being. All images used for training and testing are handled responsibly and ethically, adhering to best practices and guidelines for animal image data.

## Future Enhancements

The AnimalAngle Detector project is continually evolving. Future enhancements may include support for additional animal species, improved accuracy through ongoing model training, and integration with mobile applications and web platforms for broader accessibility.


## Conclusion

The AnimalAngle Detector is a cutting-edge project that brings together image classification and viewpoint detection to offer insights into the animal world. With practical applications and a user-friendly interface, it is poised to make a positive impact on pet care, wildlife conservation, and photography enthusiasts.
